We organize our meetings via the meetup group https://www.meetup.com/Esslingen-Makerspace/, you are welcome to join in, register as a member of that meetup group and you will receive invitations to our meetings. This documentation shall act as an archive for Resources Experiences gathered Theory For inspiration you can check the it:movES http://www.hs-esslingen.de/de/hochschule/fakultaeten/informationstechnik/aktuelles/einzelansicht/datum/2018/02/artikel/carolo-cup-2018-itmoves-belegt-vorderen-platz.html &lt; "],

How can we provide opportunity to everyone on the planet? We also believe in teaching really amazing and useful subject matter. When we decided to build the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program, to teach the world to build autonomous vehicles, we instantly knew we had to tackle our own self-driving car too. Together with Google Self-Driving Car founder and Udacity President Sebastian Thrun, we formed our core Self-Driving Car Team. One of the first decisions we made?

In this concept the XBox controller is connected via USB to a laptop (in my case a Mac) and it makes sense to store the traing data on the laptop as well since we anyway will train the NN on that machine.

The steering angle was not reproducible, i.e. sending twice the same steering command did result in different steering angles of about a few degrees difference. Now since the aim of the game is to train a neural net which takes the commanded steering angle as ground truth this was a show stopper for me and therefore i moved to =&gt; Donkey Car Second reason, other members of the group Esslinger Makerspace Projekt: Autonomen RoboCar bauen opted for donkey car. I changed to Reely Dart 2.0 Brushed Tamiya-Buchse is the connector of the NiMH battery Charger is Voltcraft V-Charge Eco NiMh 3000 7.2 What to do disassemble the sunfounder, by taking of the plate on which the raspberry is mounted disassemble the L298N H-bridge, not needed if you use an ESC Rewire the PWM signal of the car channel 1 =&gt; steering channel 0 =&gt; throttle Install Software on Pi and Host Computer Setup Raspberry Pi Setup Mac Host PC (or windows or Linux host) Calibrate your car Drive your car Train an autopilot with Keras http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/simulator/ Select web or physical controller Controller Parts 7.3 Rewiring the car The rewiring consists of Disconnect the following connections PWM signal RC receiver =&gt; Steering Servo PWM signal RC receiver =&gt; ESC Connect Battery =&gt; DC/DC converter DC/DC converter =&gt; Raspberry Pi PWM Servo Hat onto Raspberry Pi PWM Servo Hat Ch 0 =&gt; ESC PWM Servo Hat Ch 1 =&gt; Steering Servo Raspberry Pi =&gt; Raspberry Pi camera The resulting wiring diagram can be seen in figure 7.1 Figure 7.1: Wiring diagram after rewiring car So there are only two PWM signal wires from the PWM Servo Hat to the car and the power supply needs to be connected to the DC/DC converter. A close-up on the PWM Servo Hat is given in fig 7.2 Figure 7.2: Close-up of PWM Servo Hat 7.3.1 Parts list The following list is what I used to build the car, this does not mean there are better and/or cheaper options available. In total the cost is about 250€. Reely Dart 2.0 Brushed ca. 130€ Raspberry Pi ca. 34€ Raspbery Pi camera ca. 25€ PWM Servo Hat ca. 32€ DC/DC converter ca. 4€, WiiU controller ca. 18€ Tamiya Stecker Power wires ca. 9€ Stuff to mechanically integrate the new elements into the car. 7.3.2 Why not using PCA9685 Note, there seems to be an issue with driving two servos with PCA9685 at the same time. What happens is that steering and throttle work during calibration but not when the car is controlled via the web interface. TBC A possible cure is described at Adafruit 16 Channel Servo Driver with Raspberry Pi. When to add an optional Capacitor to the driver board We have a spot on the PCB for soldering in an electrolytic capacitor. Based on your usage, you may or may not need a capacitor. If you are driving a lot of servos from a power supply that dips a lot when the servos move, n * 100uF where n is the number of servos is a good place to start - eg 470uF or more for 5 servos. Since its so dependent on servo current draw, the torque on each motor, and what power supply, there is no “one magic capacitor value” we can suggest which is why we don’t include a capacitor in the kit. I did not check whether this works. The now used PWM SERVO HAT 2327 By ADAFRUIT INDUSTRIES did not show any problem controlling two channels at the same time 7.4 Folders created during installation of host PC /Users/uwesterr/mycar/models /Users/uwesterr/mycar/data /Users/uwesterr/mycar/logs 7.5 Calibrate the car Instructions for the calibrations can be found at http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/calibrate/#calibrate-your-car ssh into your raspberry ### Steering Calibration run donkey calibrate --channel &lt;your_steering_channel&gt; for PWM channel 1 for steering donkey calibrate --channel 1 (env) pi@donkeypi_uwe:~ $ donkey calibrate --channel 1 using donkey version: 2.5.8 ...

Since there might be a lot of data after a while you might want to delete archive copy it from the Raspberry Pi to your computer data 7.10.1 Archiving data Archiving can be done by renaming the tub folder with the mv command. The mv command moves, or renames, files and directories on your file system. To move the tub folder, i.e rename it, to tubArchive use mv tub tubArchive more details on mv can be found at https://www.computerhope.com/unix/umv.htm 7.10.2 Delete data Once you want to get rid of the data use the following command rm -rf tub More on rm can be found at https://www.computerhope.com/unix/urm.htm 7.10.3 Copy files from raspi to mac copy file from pi to mac run in terminal scp pi@192.168.178.67:mycar/manage.py # or rsync -r pi@192.168.178.67:~/mycar/data/ ~/mycar/data/ then type the password of the pi, afterwards the the file mycar/manage.py is being copied to the current location.

The first part describes in detail how to add a part to the vehicle. In short, a part will be added to the vehicle class and for each iteration of the loop the run or the run_threaded method of the added class will be executed. The stacking of the methods are shown in figure 8.1 Figure 8.1: Stacking of methods with from donkeycar.vehicle import Vehicle the Vehicle class is available and is instantiated by V = Vehicle() 8.1.1 Function V.start() To start vehicle’s main drive loop. V.start() This is the main thread of the vehicle. It starts all the new threads for the threaded parts then starts an infinite loop that runs each part and updates the memory. A Vehicle has memory parts threads Boolean flag “ON” 8.1.1.1 Parameters of V.start() The parameters for V.start() are rate_hz : int (default = 10Hz) The max frequency that the drive loop should run. The actual frequency may be less than this if there are many blocking parts. max_loop_count : int (default = None) Maximum number of loops the drive loop should execute. This is used for testing the all the parts of the vehicle work. 8.1.1.2 Main run loop of V.start() The main run loop of the V.start() function is below. The sleep_time assures that the loop rate is achieved. This can only be guaranteed if the update process duration of the parts does not exceed the loop time. loop_count = 0 while self.on: start_time = time.time() loop_count += 1 self.update_parts() # stop drive loop if loop_count exceeds max_loopcount if max_loop_count and loop_count &gt; max_loop_count: self.on = False sleep_time = 1.0 / rate_hz - (time.time() - start_time) if sleep_time &gt; 0.0: time.sleep(sleep_time) 8.1.2 Function V.update_parts() In the V.update_parts() function the appropriate run function of part are being called. 8.1.2.1 Parameters of V.parts() There are no parameters 8.1.2.2 Loop over all parts The following code will be looped over for all parts for entry in self.parts: # don&#39;t run if there is a run condition that is False run = True if entry.get(&#39;run_condition&#39;): run_condition = entry.get(&#39;run_condition&#39;) run = self.mem.get([run_condition])[0] # print(&#39;run_condition&#39;, entry[&#39;part&#39;], entry.get(&#39;run_condition&#39;), run) if run: p = entry[&#39;part&#39;] # get inputs from memory inputs = self.mem.get(entry[&#39;inputs&#39;]) # run the part if entry.get(&#39;thread&#39;): outputs = p.run_threaded(*inputs) else: outputs = p.run(*inputs) # save the output to memory if outputs is not None: self.mem.put(entry[&#39;outputs&#39;], outputs) It checks whether the part has inputs and passes the input to p.run_threaded if the part is threaded `p.run if the part is not threaded If there are outputs the are passed to the output of the part using the name of the keys supplied by the call. The names of the inputs and outputs are defined when the parts are added via the V.add()function 8.1.3 Function V.add Method to add a part to the vehicle drive loop. The names of parts in- and outputs are defined by the parameters of the V.addfunction 8.1.3.1 Parameters of V.add() inputs : list Channel names to get from memory. outputs : list Channel names to save to memory. threaded : Boolean If a part should be run in a separate thread. run_condition: Boolean If a part should be run at all. 8.1.3.2 Example to add Web controller The web controller is first instantiated and then added using the V.add()function. The names of in- and outputs are supplied as well as the indicator that the controller is threaded. More on threaded parts in section 8.1.4 ctr = LocalWebController(use_chaos=use_chaos) V.add(ctr, inputs=[&#39;cam/image_array&#39;], outputs=[&#39;user/angle&#39;, &#39;user/throttle&#39;, &#39;user/mode&#39;, &#39;recording&#39;], threaded=True) 8.1.3.3 Example add Bluetooth Controller To add a Bluetooth controller add the following lines to manage.py in the drive method from donkeypart_bluetooth_game_controller import BluetoothGameController ctl = BluetoothGameController() V.add(ctl, inputs=[&#39;cam/image_array&#39;], outputs=[&#39;user/angle&#39;, &#39;user/throttle&#39;, &#39;user/mode&#39;, &#39;recording&#39;], threaded=True) 8.1.4 Concept of threads vs non-threaded parts Updating of the parts is run in the loop of the V.update(). To avoid that parts which take long to update blocks the loop they can be assigned to a dedicated thread. Whenever the a threaded part is updated the run_threadedmethod is run. For a camera the run_threaded is def run_threaded(self): return self.frame which returns the frame available at the time, no delay being imposed on the loop. 8.1.4.1 The update function Images are taken constantly as fast as possible by the method update as shown below def update(self): # keep looping infinitely until the thread is stopped for f in self.stream: # grab the frame from the stream and clear the stream in # preparation for the next frame self.frame = f.array self.rawCapture.truncate(0) # if the thread indicator variable is set, stop the thread if not self.on: break 8.1.4.2 The shutdown function To stop the thread a shutdownfunction needs to be defined def shutdown(self): # indicate that the thread should be stopped self.on = False print(&#39;stoping PiCamera&#39;) time.sleep(.5) self.stream.close() self.rawCapture.close() self.camera.close() 8.2 Structure of manage.py manage.py contains scripts to drive a donkey 2 car and train a model for it. The structure of manage.pyis well explained by Tawn Kramer in Donkeycar Parts Overview Pt 2/2 8.2.1 Creating manage.py manage.pyis created when donkey createcar --path ~/d2 and is a copy of /templates/donkey2.py If you want to add other templates this can be done by adding the name of the template without the extension “.py”. donkey createcar --path ~/d2 --template tk Then tk.pywill be copied into manage.py 8.2.2 Starting manage.py In order to start manage.py without the need to write pyhton chmode +x manage.py ./manage.py The line #!/usr/bin/env python3 makes sure that the script is run with pyhton3. 8.2.3 Parsing the command line parameters docopt is a Command-line interface description language with which the following options are parsed. The parsed inputs are then used by if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: args = docopt(__doc__) cfg = dk.load_config() if args[&#39;drive&#39;]: drive(cfg, model_path=args[&#39;--model&#39;], use_chaos=args[&#39;--chaos&#39;]) elif args[&#39;train&#39;]: tub = args[&#39;--tub&#39;] new_model_path = args[&#39;--model&#39;] base_model_path = args[&#39;--base_model&#39;] cache = not args[&#39;--no_cache&#39;] train(cfg, tub, new_model_path, base_model_path) Note, the if __name__ == '__main__': part is only run if the code is called as first script. The __doc__ string is the text block at the beginning of the script. Parameters in () are mandatory, parameters in [ ] are optional.

Each part runs as a job in the Vehicle loop, calling either it’s run or run_threaded method depending on the constructor flag threaded. All parts are updated one after another at the framerate given in cfg.DRIVE_LOOP_HZ assuming each part finishes processing in a timely manner. Parts may have named outputs and inputs. The framework handles passing named outputs to parts requesting the same named input. 8.2.4.1 Lambda class Lambda wraps a function into a donkey part, i.e. it will be called for every update loop. class Lambda: &quot;&quot;&quot; Wraps a function into a donkey part. &quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, f): &quot;&quot;&quot; Accepts the function to use. &quot;&quot;&quot; self.f = f def run(self, *args, **kwargs): return self.f(*args, **kwargs) def shutdown(self): return The function is defined as usual put then apply Lambdato defined function V.add output of Lambda # See if we should even run the pilot module. # This is only needed because the part run_condition only accepts boolean def pilot_condition(mode): if mode == &#39;user&#39;: return False else: return True pilot_condition_part = Lambda(pilot_condition) V.add(pilot_condition_part, inputs=[&#39;user/mode&#39;], outputs=[&#39;run_pilot&#39;]) The output run_pilotis used to define whether or not klis run. V.add(kl, inputs=[&#39;cam/image_array&#39;], outputs=[&#39;pilot/angle&#39;, &#39;pilot/throttle&#39;], run_condition=&#39;run_pilot&#39;) 8.3 Locate modules on raspi which are being imported by manage.py Where on the Raspberry Pi are the modules located which are being imported by the python script manage.py from docopt import docopt import donkeycar as dk from donkeycar.parts.camera import PiCamera from donkeycar.parts.transform import Lambda from donkeycar.parts.keras import KerasLinear from donkeycar.parts.actuator import PCA9685, PWMSteering, PWMThrottle from donkeycar.parts.datastore import TubGroup, TubWriter from donkeycar.parts.web_controller import LocalWebController from donkeycar.parts.clock import Timestamp from donkeypart_bluetooth_game_controller import BluetoothGameController donkeycar is found at the raspi (env) pi@donkeypi_uwe:~ $ find . -name donkeycar ./env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/donkeycar listing this folder (env) pi@donkeypi_uwe:~ $ cd ./env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/donkeycar (env) pi@donkeypi_uwe:~/env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/donkeycar $ ls config.py __init__.py log.py management memory.py parts __pycache__ templates tests util vehicle.py which are the same files and folders which are located at the official GitHub page of DonkeyCar project The donkeypart_bluetooth_game_controller was installed during the set up of the raspi for the project as described in section 7.7.1 8.4 Assignment of WiiU controller sticks to action The mapping from button codes to button names is defined in donkeypart_bluetooth_game_controller/wiiu_config.yml device_search_term: &#39;nintendo&#39; #Map the button codes to the button names button_map: 305: &#39;A&#39; 304: &#39;B&#39; 307: &#39;X&#39; 308: &#39;Y&#39; 312: &#39;LEFT_BOTTOM_TRIGGER&#39; 310: &#39;LEFT_TOP_TRIGGER&#39; 313: &#39;RIGHT_BOTTOM_TRIGGER&#39; 311: &#39;RIGHT_TOP_TRIGGER&#39; 317: &#39;LEFT_STICK_PRESS&#39; 318: &#39;RIGHT_STICK_PRESS&#39; 314: &#39;SELECT&#39; 315: &#39;START&#39; 0: &#39;LEFT_STICK_X&#39; 1: &#39;LEFT_STICK_Y&#39; 3: &#39;RIGHT_STICK_X&#39; 4: &#39;RIGHT_STICK_Y&#39; 547: &#39;PAD_RIGHT&#39; 546: &#39;PAD_LEFT&#39; 544: &#39;PAD_UP&#39; 548: &#39;PAD_DOWN&#39; joystic_max_value: 1280 which is then used in donkeypart_bluetooth_game_controller/part.py In the class definition BluetoothGameController def __init__(self, event_input_device=None, config_path=None, device_search_term=None, verbose=False): . . . self.func_map = { &#39;LEFT_STICK_X&#39;: self.update_angle, &#39;LEFT_STICK_Y&#39;: self.update_throttle, &#39;B&#39;: self.toggle_recording, &#39;A&#39;: self.toggle_drive_mode, &#39;PAD_UP&#39;: self.increment_throttle_scale, &#39;PAD_DOWN&#39;: self.decrement_throttle_scale, } It seems to be odd to have steering and throttle on one stick, to assign throttle to the right stick change donkeypart_bluetooth_game_controller/part.py to self.func_map = { &#39;LEFT_STICK_X&#39;: self.update_angle, &#39;RIGHT_STICK_Y&#39;: self.update_throttle, to make the controller more sensitive it might be a good idea to limit the max joystick value in donkeypart_bluetooth_game_controller/wiiu_config.yml to the max value needed which is according to 7.5.2 8.5 Limit max velocity To avoid that the car becomes too fast change in manage.py the max_pulse value. Note, the value is dependend of your cfg.THROTTLE_STOPPED_PWM, the max_pulse value ought to be a bit higher than the cfg.THROTTLE_STOPPED_PWM. You might want to find out a suitable value by using the calibration mode which you used to find the max values. throttle = PWMThrottle(controller=throttle_controller, max_pulse=cfg.THROTTLE_FORWARD_PWM, zero_pulse=cfg.THROTTLE_STOPPED_PWM, min_pulse=cfg.THROTTLE_REVERSE_PWM) to throttle = PWMThrottle(controller= throttle_controller, max_pulse=413, zero_pulse=cfg.THROTTLE_STOPPED_PWM, min_pulse=cfg.THROTTLE_REVERSE_PWM) Or you can set in config.py the variable THROTTLE_FORWARD_PWM which defines the max throttle value to a value which gives you a low enough speed to master the track. THROTTLE_FORWARD_PWM = 413 "],
