## Wiring of PCA9685 with L298N H-bridge
Since the raspberry pi PWM signal is not very stable the I2C interface is used to connect to to the servo driver PCA9685.

If a higher voltage is needed the motor driver L298N H-bridge can be utilized.

Each H-Bridge requires two additional signals: 

- turn motor CW
- turn motor CCW
- no signal => motor brakes

## sensor fusion of LIDAR and camera data
Paper by 
Varuna De Silva, Jamie Roche, and Ahmet Kondoz, Senior Member, IEEE  **Fusion of LiDAR and Camera Sensor Data for Environment Sensing in Driverless Vehicles**  
This paper addresses the problem of fusing the outputs of a LiDAR scanner and a wide-angle monocular image sensor. The first part of the proposed framework spatially aligns the two sensor data streams with a geometric model. The resolutions of the two sensors are quite different, with the image sensor having a much denser spatial resolution.
