Here I will write down how the adventure goes

## Install donkey car on Mac

http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/install_software/#install-donkeycar-on-mac

Installation went without problem. Note: After closing the Terminal, when you open it again, you will need to type **source activate donkey** to re-enable the mappings to donkey specific Python libraries

## Donkey car simulator

http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/simulator/

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/DonkeyCarSimulator.png")
```

Typical Use

- Start simulator
- Double check that **log** dir exists and is empty
- Start scene of your choice
- Hit **Auto Drive w Rec** button
- Vary the Max Speed, Prop, and Diff sliders to obtain a variety of driving styles
- Wait 10-15 minutes until you have recorded 10K+ frames of data.
- Hit the **Stop** button
- Hit the **Exit** button
- Move the log dir to the **~/d2/data/** dir where you normally put tub data. - This will create a **~/d2/data/log** path.
- Train as usual.
