# Donkey Command-line Utilities

This chapter is copied from the [donkey car utility doc](https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar/blob/e23f8f1d2478a4d2132cd8b09e27faa00b393ff7/docs/utility/donkey.md)

The `donkey` command is created when you install the donkeycar Python package. This is a Python script that adds some important functionality. The operations here are vehicle independent, and should work on any hardware configuration.

## Create Car

This command creates a new dir which will contain the files needed to run and train your robot.

Usage:
```bash
donkey createcar --path <dir> [--overwrite] [--template <donkey2>]
```

* This command may be run from any dir
* Run on the host computer or the robot
* It uses the `--path` as the destination dir to create. If `.py` files exist there, it will not overwrite them, unless the optional `--overwrite` is used.
* The optional `--template` will specify the template file to start from. For a list of templates, see the `donkeycar/templates` dir

## Find Car

This command attempts to locate your car on the local network using nmap.

Usage:
```bash
donkey findcar
```

* Run on the host computer
* Prints the host computer IP address and the car IP address if found
* Requires the nmap utility:
```bash
sudo apt install nmap
```

## Calibrate Car

This command allows you to manually enter values to interactively set the PWM values and experiment with how your robot responds.
See also [more information.](http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/calibrate/#calibrate-your-car)

Usage:
```bash
donkey calibrate --channel <0-15 channel id>
```

* Run on the host computer
* Opens the PWM channel specified by `--channel`
* Type integer values to specify PWM values and hit enter
* Hit `Ctrl + C` to exit

## Clean data in Tub

Opens a web server to delete bad data from a tub.

Usage:
```
donkey tubclean <folder containing tubs>
```

* Run on pi or host computer.
* Opens the web server to delete bad data.
* Hit `Ctrl + C` to exit


## Make Movie from Tub

This command allows you to create a movie file from the images in a Tub.

Usage:
```bash
donkey makemovie <tub_path> [--out=<tub_movie.mp4>] [--config=<config.py>]
```

* Run on the host computer or the robot
* Uses the image records from `--tub` dir path given
* Creates a movie given by `--out`. Codec is inferred from file extension. Default: `tub_movie.mp4`
* Optional argument to specify a different `config.py` other than default: `config.py`



## Check Tub {#tubclean}

This command allows you to see how many records are contained in any/all tubs. It will also open each record and ensure that the data is readable and intact. If not, it will allow you to remove corrupt records.

Usage:
```
donkey tubcheck <tub_path> [--fix]
```

* Run on the host computer or the robot
* It will print summary of record count and channels recorded for each tub
* It will print the records that throw an exception while reading
* The optional `--fix` will delete records that have problems


## Histogram

This command will show a pop-up window showing the histogram of record values in a given tub.


Usage:
```bash
donkey tubhist <tub_path> --rec=<"user/angle">
```

* Run on the host computer

* When the `--tub` is omitted, it will check all tubs in the default data dir


## Plot Predictions

This command allows you plot steering and throttle against predictions coming from a trained model.

Usage:
```bash
donkey tubplot <tub_path> [--model=<model_path>]
```

* This command may be run from `~/mycar` dir
* Run on the host computer
* Will show a pop-up window showing the plot of steering values in a given tub compared to NN predictions from the trained model
* When the `--tub` is omitted, it will check all tubs in the default data dir


## Simulation Server

This command allows you serve steering and throttle controls to a simulated vehicle using the [Donkey Simulator](/guide/simulator.md).

Usage:
```bash
donkey sim --model=<model_path> [--type=<linear|categorical>] [--top_speed=<speed>] [--config=<config.py>]
```

* This command may be run from `~/mycar` dir
* Run on the host computer
* Uses the model to make predictions based on images and telemetry from the simulator
* `--type` can specify whether the model needs angle output to be treated as categorical
* Top speed can be modified to ascertain stability at different goal speeds
